This May, I submitted an [entry for the data analysis competition at the 2020 Sounders FC Soccer Analytics Conference](https://www.soundersfc.com/socceranalytics). The challenge was to create data visualizations to help teams prepare for matches or sign new players.

Para minha análise, utilizei os dados abertos da StatsBomb. Me coloquei no lugar de um analista da Croácia prestes a enfrentar a França na final da Copa do Mundo de 2018 e fiz recomendações para o treinador. Aqui está a análise que enviei, junto com um pequeno comentário sobre cada slide:

For my analysis, I used StatsBomb’s open data. I studied the “pressing” strategies for Croatia before facing France in the 2018 World Cup Final and make recommendations. Here is my entry for the competition along with a short comment on each slide

**Analysis**

First, I looked at French players who had a low pass completion when pressed as well as their average distance from goal. This chart showed that **Matuidi and Umtiti** are interesting pressing targets, since they can generate high value turnovers which Croatia could explore

Then, I zoomed in the passing patterns for Umtiti and Matuidi when pressed. Knowing how they react to pressure can make a high pressing strategy even more effective. Umtiti tends to play either back to **Lloris** or forward to **Kanté**. Matuidi passes mostly **Griezmann** on the left.

The next logical question is: “who should press the key targets?”. Looking at the chart for pressure regains by average position on the field gave a clear answer: **Mandzukic and Perisic**.

Kovacic, who was not a regular starter, could also help with the pressing strategy

Ideally, these are the key points I would like communicate to a manager or analyst who sees this report. I believe it is straight to the point, insightful and applicable.

-   Key pressing targets: Matuidi & Umtiti
-   Key pressers: Mandzukic & Perisic
-   Surprise element: Kovacic

**Outcome**

I was extremely happy to be in the Top 10 analysis of the competition. It was a fun exercise, specially during this soccer-less period. I would like to thank the organizers and judges.
