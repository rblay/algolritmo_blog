Algolritmo's mission is to bring a mathematical and statistical perspective to soccer analysis, with a focus on the Brazilian tournaments and the main European Leagues. Several publications such as "Soccernomics", "The Numbers Game", "Mathletics" and "Soccermatics" have demonstrated how data analysis is a great complement to soccer's magic, human and imponderable side. With this mentality, we seek to bring a new perspective to the beautiful game.
